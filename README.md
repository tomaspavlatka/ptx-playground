# Tomas Pavlatka: Playground

I get bored from some to time and therefore I look for challenges to solve. Most of the challenges come from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) but hopefully I will not be limited by them for ever.

I am usually not so focus on the speed of the algorith, rather than having workable solution. I revisit the solutions from time to time and try to optimize them.

I use typescript to solve the challeges.
